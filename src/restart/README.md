## Restart: an extension of Booksim 2.0, the Cycle accurate NoC simulator to host trace-like simulations

The following repository hosts a modified version of Booksim 2.0 (https://github.com/booksim/booksim2) which  natively supports a wide range of network topologies, such as mesh, torus and flattened butterfly networks, provides diverse routing algorithms and includes numerous options for customizing the network's router microarchitecture.
Originally the code works using synthetic workloads, generated by the simulator at run time, based on the selected traffic pattern.
Given its modular design and lack of reliance on external libraies, the code presents itself among the NoC simulator as one of the most versatile and easy to use.
This extension allows the user to provide a trace-like file (effectively a list of high-level descriptions of the packets) for the simulator to process.
This allows for more application-specific simulations.

The extension is - heavily - based on the original Booksim 2.0 code, and it is compatible with the original configuration files' parameters, but uses the JSON format.

Have a look at the <code>how_to_use.ipynb</code> file for more information on how to use this modified version of the simulator.
